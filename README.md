### About/Overview:
This project implements the classic game of Hangman with a malevolent twist using an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree for word 
storage and vectors for efficient data manipulation. The game is designed to make it challenging for the player by dynamically 
changing the selected word as they make guesses.

### Features:
1. Evil Hangman gameplay
2. AVL tree for efficient word storage and retrieval
3. Vectors for dynamic storage of game-related information
4. Unit tests to ensure code correctness

### How To Play:
1. Run the executable.
2. The game will prompt you to enter the length of the word you want to guess.
3. You will then be asked to enter the amount of attempts you would like.
4. Make guesses by entering letters.
5. The game will provide feedback on your guesses.
6. Keep guessing until you either correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
